# dimension-drawer
This is a tool to show a 3D drawing of a physical thing alongside tennis ball for scale. 

Developed as part of our work for the British Museum, we made a thing that shows viewers the size of all the objects in a special collection held there, called the Waddesdon Bequest. We drew a representation of each object as a 3D shape, and added what we thought was a relatively universal object -- a tennis ball -- alongside, so people can get a feel for its size.

(We've had a feature request from New Zealand to swap the tennis ball for a rugby ball. Let's see who wins the World Cup!) :)
